# FBI

## Description

In this work we try to get a robot portrait using an autoencoder and a genetic algorithm.
This package contains ... methods (+what are they used for)
This package also contains tutorials, directory and data that allow our package to run.

### Application

The GUI of our project. The victim chooses a selection of images that fit the best its agressor. The window shows faces that are mutated but also faces that are from our DB. You can find there a tutoriel on how to use the GUI.

### Autoencoder

Algorithm used to encode and decode the images.

### GeneticAlgo

Algorithm that compute the mutation over the encoded images.
